# homeautomation-Iot-
making voice controllable house using Nodemcu or esp8266 chip

before starting all stuffs you need are mention below...

*preferred:Nodemcu( cost - Rs 320) or esp8266( cost rs -140)
FTDI usb to ttl(cost rs-140) or usb to ttl basic(cost rs-70) or arduino uno/nano/....**( NOT REQUIRED IF PURCHASED NODEMCU)**
jumping wires , breadboard ,resistors (1K,2.2Kand 10K )
thats more than enough hardware ...

softwares
arduino ide
putty(can be used)
i2c serialbus checker(esp8266 testing)
 DONE...
 
 before you starting purachning things its better if you see through all and find what need =s to purchsed and whats not here arduino is just used for connecting the modules to pc for uploading code in them .
 
 Hope you enjoy making the project .
