The project aims at designing an advanced home automation system using Blynk web server and Nodemcu technology. 

The devices can be switched ON/OFF and sensors can be read using a Voice commands like google assistant , Alexa , etc, through Wi-Fi.

Automation is the most frequently spelled term in the field of electronics. The hunger for automation brought many revolutions in the 
existing technologies. These had greater importance than any other technologies due to its user-friendly nature. 

These can be used as a replacement of the existing switches in home which produces sparks and also results in fire accidents in few 
situations. Considering the advantages of Wi-Fi an advanced automation system was developed to control the appliances in the house.

Wi-Fi (Short for Wireless Fidelity) is a wireless technology that uses radio frequency to transmit data through the air. Wi-Fi has 
initial speeds of 1mbps to 2mbps. Wi-Fi transmits data in the frequency band of 2.4 â€“ 2.5 GHz. It implements the concept of frequency
division multiplexing technology. Range of Wi-Fi technology is 40-300 feet.

The controlling device for the automation in the project is a Nodemcu (Esp8266). The data sent from Mobile over Wi-Fi will be received
by  Nodemcu and 

Arduino UNO. Arduino UNO reads the data and decides the webhook switch and process the data send signals to the nodemcu ,then nodemcu decide to turn on/off electrical devices connected to it through Relays.
